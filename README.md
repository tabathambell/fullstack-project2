# Creepventures

## Description

This application uses Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Google Maps API.

Creepventures is a social media based blog system that allows users, once they register, to make posts and add locations of haunted locations that reflect on the map on the home page. Once logged in, they are able to make comments and favorite posts on their dashboard. They are able to edit and delete their own posts and interact with other users on the posts through the comments. 

The map is able to be moved by holding and dragging across the world map. Red pinpoints will appear in the areas that the blog posts were made as long as they were tagged in the post. The most recent posts will be displayed on the home page in the order they were posted in small blocks, but you can view the posts in the header by clicking on the dashboard. Here, you can view any of the posts you have made in bigger displays and edit how you would like.
